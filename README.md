# Flock-Market

# Module Description:

-The product will comprise two different UIs for both the users and shopkeepers. While users can search items, know what items are in demand, add to cart and buy items, the shopkeepers can register their shop, add items that they are selling, know what items are trending so they can keep stock for these items. Additional features such as user recommendations for items are also being considered to be added. 
-The backend comprises multiple schemas (that of a user, a shopkeeper and even an item). User authentication will be used to prevent unauthorized access to different pathways such as that of a shopkeeper. Different sign-ups for both users and shopkeepers will help us reduce the confusion that can be created while creating their schemas from the request body in the POST request.
